Optical Character recognition (OCR) plays an important role in processing image based documents. 
Easyocr and Pytesseract are two popular OCR tools used to extract text from images.


One of the the more obvious differences between them is that Easyocr supports 40 languages whereas Tesseract supports 60 languages.

Another difference can be seen in terms of their output format. Tesseract merely outputs the text whereas Easyocr will give the bounding box coordinates, text generated, and confidence respectively.

After trying a considerable number of images with alphabets and numbers, I noticed that Tesseract gives a higher accuracy for alphabets whereas Easyocr gives higher accuracy in case of numbers.
